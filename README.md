# Galactic Contention for Battlefront 2 (2017)
Experiment to see how close you can bring Battlefront 2 (2017) to the popular Squad Mod "Galactic Contention"

When I see peoples reaction to videos of the popular Squad Mod "Galactic Contention" it's always something along the lines of "This is what Battlefront 2 should have been".
And yet nobody has tried to replicate what the mod does in an original Star Wars game.

While the Squad Mod recieves good feedback and has achieved an amazing feat for sure, the servers for it are surprisingly less populated.
My belief is that this is because the game is not originally a Star Wars game, so people normally do not come across it unless they bought the game Squad AND looked at the workshop. Of course friends, youtuber and articles could get the word out there aswell to inform more people of its existence, but apparently something is lacking.

And of course when you take a closer look at the mod it is apparent where it's lacking, where the areas are that need polishing etc, but it does not change the fact that at its core you get a really really immersive Star Wars large scale warfare experience.


So here we are, limit testing the modding capabilities of Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017).
